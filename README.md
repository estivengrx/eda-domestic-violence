EDA-domestic-violence
==============================
This EDA contains three notebooks:
1. data-cleaning, where I did data cleaning process and exported raw and cleaned data
2. Domestic-violenceEDA-v1, where all the great stuff was done, I presented results as answering different questions I had and giving out some insights about the data.
3. data-profile-report, where there is a nice-looking report from pandas_profiling library which shows main aspects of the data, descriptive aspects and the distribution of it.



The present EDA is based on the dataset provided by DIJIN (Directorate of Criminal Investigation and INTERPOL of the National Police) and National Police from Colombia, which contains updates about data from all over the country on domestic violence reported between 2010 and 2022, the most recent of which was on December 9 (Last update).
